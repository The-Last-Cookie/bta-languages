# Translation support for Minecraft Better Than Adventure (BTA)

BTA is based on Minecraft's beta version. Translation support for this version is not great. For some languages, translations may exist, though often outdated. This project wants to serve as a platform to centralise translations for BTA.

This project is **not officially affiliated** with BTA!

The below table lists languages included in this repository and their progress. BTA version refers to the version in which all texts will be up-to-date. The language packs can be used in different versions of BTA, however, texts may be incomplete or fallback to their English original if the translation is missing entirely.

| Language | Progress | BTA version |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| German | in progress | 7.3 |
| French | planned | 7.3 |
